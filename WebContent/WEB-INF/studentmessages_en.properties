//Spring MVC would search for a key matching with this key pattern-
[Validation Annotation Name].[Object Reference Name].[Field Name]
	e.g in this case, Size.student.studentHobby
	
//Size.student.studentHobby = please enter a value for studentHobby field between 2 and 30 characters.

Size.student.studentHobby = please enter a value for {0} field between {2} and {1} characters.
Pattern.student.studentName = please do not use digit in value of {0} field
//Spring MVC uses alphabetical order of the arguments to decide upon which placeholder to be replaced with which argument value

//If above key pattern not found, then Spring MVC would again search for a key matching with this key pattern-
[Validation Annotation Name].[Field Name]
	e.g in this case, Size.studentHobby

	
//If above key pattern not found, then Spring MVC would again search for a key matching with this key pattern-
[Validation Annotation Name].[Field Type]
	e.g in this case, Size.java.lang.String
	
	
//If above key pattern not found, then Spring MVC would again search for a key matching with this key pattern-
[Validation Annotation Name]
	e.g in this case, Size

	
If above key pattern also not found, then Spring MVC would use the default error message for that
